# Quiz

When learning languages it can be both smart and fun to sometimes focus on precise areas of vocabulary, so here is a program to answer this need.


Two ways of playing a Fin/Eng translation quiz.

In the master branch, few vocabulary categories are stored in a csv file. The program imports the vocabulary lists and then use google translator (API) to provide the translated answer.

In the scrap branch, we scrap the website uusikielemme to directly import the vocabulary lists wanted (much more choices since not limited by api calls)


P.s: api calls quota full 28.06
