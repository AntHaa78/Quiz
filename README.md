# Quiz

When learning languages it can be both smart and fun to sometimes focus on precise areas of vocabulary, so here is a program to answer this need.


Few ways of playing a Fin/Eng translation quiz.

Quiz.py for a simple and direct way of playing in the terminal, vocabulary is in vocab kappale.csv

In the quiz with API fodler, few vocabulary categories are stored in a csv file. The program imports the vocabulary lists and then use google translator (API) to provide the translated answer.

In the quiz scrap folder, we scrap the website uusikielemme.fi to directly import the vocabulary lists wanted (much more choice since not limited by api calls)

In the GUI folder, we develop a GUI version of the scrap-version quiz. Work in progress
